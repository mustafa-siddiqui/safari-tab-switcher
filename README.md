# safari-tab-switcher

Recently used tab switcher for safari like the macOS app switcher (`cmd+tab`).

> Vibe-coded this shit with claude sonnet 4 and GPT 4.1 because I didn't want to pay for an existing extension.

## How To

After installing this extension (unoffical (for now?)), reload the page.

Press `ctrl+k` to bring up the UI and switch tabs.

- `ctrl+k` to cycle to next tab
- `ctrl+shift+k` to cycle to previous tab
